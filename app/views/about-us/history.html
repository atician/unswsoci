  <p>
    The UNSW Social Soccer Society was founded on Monday 21st March 2011 when the founding members gathered for the first Annual General Meeting at UNSW. The ultimate vision of the society was “to facilitate an organisational structure and easier networking of social soccer games at UNSW”, with other visions around keeping members connected to each other, providing cheap/free casual football games, funding for equipment and proper organised events. As subsequent years and executive members go by, this vision has changed and adapted to the needs of the members.
